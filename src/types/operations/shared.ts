/**
 * SyncOffset Operational Object Layer — Shared Contracts
 *
 * These are the constitutional primitives that every operational object
 * in SyncOffset is built from. They encode the platform's founding law:
 *
 *   - Identity is permanent. IDs do not change.
 *   - Documents belong to the object that generated them.
 *   - Events are append-only. History is never destroyed.
 *   - Acknowledgment is human. The system flags; humans clear.
 *   - Relationships are by reference ID. Embedding is for display only.
 *
 * Do NOT import component, UI, or data-layer types here.
 * Do NOT add presentation-layer fields (colors, icons, labels for UI).
 * These types map directly to future Supabase table schemas.
